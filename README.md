# ThorCore
ThorCore is a library for FTC. Not much else to say about it.
**Note: ThorCore is in beta. Development will continue throughout the season.**

#### Installation
To install, start up a terminal.
```
thor@thor:~$
```
Clone the ThorCore repo.
```
thor@thor:~$ git clone https://github.com/FTC-9974-THOR/ThorCore
```
Start up Android Studio. Select ```File > New > Import module...``` and
enter the directory you cloned ThorCore to. If everything worked right,
you should be able to run a Gradle sync without errors.

Last, you need to include ThorCore as a dependency. Open
TeamCode/build.gradle and put the following code at the end:
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation project(':ThorCore')
}

android {
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
 }
 ```
Run a Gradle sync, and you should be all set.
